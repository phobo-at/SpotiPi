# Changelog

All notable changes to SpotiPi will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-06

### 🔐 Security & Access
- Protected routes now remain usable from loopback and trusted private/LAN clients by default, avoiding browser auth prompts for common home-WLAN setups.
- JSON/XHR requests no longer trigger unwanted HTTP Basic auth browser popups when admin auth is required.

### 🎨 UI/UX
- Dashboard sleep tiles now disappear when the sleep feature flag is disabled, while active timers remain manageable.
- Removed secondary filler copy from action cards and tightened the card layout.
- Settings credentials now use inline eye toggles with masked defaults, and the settings sheet no longer overflows horizontally on small screens.
- Added a playful fallback cover for the player when Spotify artwork is unavailable.

### ⚙️ Config
- Environment-specific config files are now saved as sparse overrides over `default_config.json`, keeping shared defaults single-source and reducing drift.

### 🐛 Fixes
- `get_spotify_credentials()` now falls back to `os.environ` so credentials loaded
  at startup via `load_dotenv()` (e.g. from a repo-level `.env`) remain visible in
  the settings UI without requiring re-entry.
- `update_spotify_credentials()` now keeps `os.environ` in sync on every write,
  so disconnect and field-level deletions can no longer be masked by stale
  startup values (regression-tested).

### 🧪 Tests
- New regression tests covering the `os.environ` fallback and sync behavior, request-security trust rules, sparse config persistence, and responsive settings overflow.
- Shared `bind_spotify_runtime_env` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` — removes the
  duplicated credential test helpers.
- `pytest`: `171 passed, 2 skipped`.
- `npm run test:e2e`: `54 passed`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-04

### ✨ New Features
- Modernized frontend shell with Preact/TypeScript SPA rebuild
- `DEFAULT_VOLUME` constant in `config_schema.py` as single source of truth for default playback volume

### 🎨 UI/UX
- Removed "Jetzt synchronisieren" button — auto-polling (4s) makes manual sync redundant
- Fixed "Warte auf Spotify" status showing even when track data is already available from previous poll
- Removed development notes from production UI (insight cards, section subtitles, footer badge)
- Default volume lowered from 50% to 20%

### 🧪 Tests
- `pytest -q` → `133 passed, 2 skipped`

## [1.5.2] - 2026-03-17

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed optimistic playback toggles so the UI rolls back correctly on normal HTTP failures instead of staying visually flipped.
- Fixed playback/dashboard snapshot rendering so `pending`, `auth_required`, error, and real playback states are handled explicitly.
- Fixed thread-safe config snapshots to return isolated deep copies, preventing nested mutation leaks through cached config objects.
- Fixed token bootstrap on clean installs by adding the missing `spotipy` dependency.

### ⚡ Runtime & Contracts
- Moved Spotify auth/health status checks onto cache-only code paths so health endpoints no longer trigger blocking token refreshes or device discovery.
- Formalized the async snapshot contract: `/api/dashboard/status` and `/playback_status` return `202 Accepted` while hydration is still pending or auth is required.
- Standardized runtime secrets on `~/.spotipi/.env` with stricter generator output and systemd alignment.
- Raised the documented runtime baseline to Python 3.10+.

### 🧪 Tests
- `pytest -q` → `121 passed, 2 skipped`

- Reduced motion support for accessibility (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`)

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated Copilot instructions with v1.5.0 UI patterns and guidelines

## [1.4.0] - 2025-01-13

### 🔒 Security
- **Token Encryption at Rest**: New `src/utils/token_encryption.py` module encrypts Spotify tokens using Fernet encryption (with `cryptography` library) or XOR obfuscation fallback
- Machine-derived keys ensure tokens cannot be transferred between devices
- Token files now have restricted permissions (0o600 - owner read/write only)
- Backward compatible: automatically reads legacy plain JSON tokens and re-encrypts on next save

### ⚡ Performance
- **Global ThreadPoolExecutor**: Library loading now reuses a singleton executor (`_get_library_executor()`) instead of creating executors per-call, reducing thread creation overhead on Pi Zero
- Optimized `spotify.py` token save/load operations with encryption integration

### 🏗 Architecture
- **Route Blueprints (Prepared)**: Modular blueprint structure in `src/routes/` (alarm, sleep, music, playback, devices, health, cache, services) ready for future integration
- Cleaner code organization without breaking current app.py structure

### 🧪 Tests

- **Alarm Settings Save**: Fixed `log_structured()` parameter conflict causing 400 BAD REQUEST errors when saving alarm settings
- **CORS Configuration**: Improved CORS header handling to support port-agnostic hostname matching (e.g., `http://spotipi.local:5000`)
- **Settings UI**: Fixed HTML escaping in alarm status messages to prevent template literal syntax errors with special characters in device names

### ✨ UI/UX Improvements
- **Smooth Animations**: Added CSS transitions (fade + slide) for alarm and sleep timer activation/deactivation with 300ms duration
- **Device Sorting**: Devices are now sorted alphabetically (A-Z, case-insensitive) in all dropdown menus for better usability

### 🎨 Frontend
- Enhanced `utilities.css` with smooth show/hide animations using opacity, transform, and max-height transitions
- Added `smoothShow()` and `smoothHide()` helper functions in JavaScript for consistent animation behavior
- Fixed sleep timer toggle visibility issue during state transitions

### 🔧 Technical
- Updated device name validation pattern from restrictive allowlist to blocklist approach supporting full Unicode range
- Improved error handling with proper structured logging parameter names (`validation_message`, `error_message`)

## [1.3.8] - 2025-10-24

### 🏗 Service Layer Consolidation
- Slimmed all Flask controllers so they delegate validation and business rules to their respective services (`alarm`, `sleep`, `spotify`, `system`), yielding consistent JSON contracts across basic and advanced endpoints.
- Extended the Spotify service with toggle, volume, and playback helpers to remove duplicated logic in `/toggle_play_pause`, `/volume`, and `/play`.
- Hardened dashboard snapshots and error handlers to use the shared service responses, keeping template rendering stable even for 404/500 fallbacks.

### 📚 Unified Music Library Flow
- Centralised hashing, slimming, and caching through `_build_library_response` so `/api/music-library` and `/api/music-library/sections` now emit identical headers/ETag semantics.
- Expanded `prepare_library_payload` to track partial section metadata and cached flags in one place.

### 🧹 Cleanup & Frontend
- Removed unused HTTP session overrides and stale imports, trimmed no-op utilities, and deduplicated the toast notification implementation (now exported solely from `ui.js`).
- Documented the “controllers thin, services rich” architecture and unified library pipeline in the README.

### 🧪 Tests
- `python3.11 -m pytest -q`

## [1.3.7] - 2025-10-23

### ⚡ Instant First Load
- Reworked the `/` route to deliver a slim HTML shell without Spotify calls, cutting cold-start TTFB to well under one second while keeping warm hits around the 400 ms target.
- Added structured snapshots for dashboard, playback, and device data so hydration happens asynchronously without blocking Flask workers.
- Updated the UI with accessible skeleton placeholders and clearer fallback messaging (e.g., “Keine aktive Wiedergabe”) while removing the distracting status banner.

### 🧠 Backend & Transport
- Introduced an `AsyncSnapshot` helper plus background warm-up to keep cached Spotify state fresh outside of request threads.
- Enabled Flask-Compress and long-lived static caching to trim payload sizes on the Raspberry Pi.
- Hardened playback/device fetch fallbacks so the initial shell renders cleanly even when Spotify auth or devices are still warming up.

### 🛠 Deployment & Tooling
- Optimised `scripts/deploy_to_pi.sh` to copy systemd units only when they change (override with `SPOTIPI_FORCE_SYSTEMD=1`), speeding up day-to-day syncs.
- Added `scripts/bench_first_load.sh` for quick TTFB/first-paint measurements alongside the existing benchmark suite.
- Updated documentation to highlight the new workflow and measurement tooling.

## [1.3.6] - 2025-10-20

### ⏰ Alarm Reliability Hardening
- Rebuilt the in-process scheduler on top of a monotonic clock with UTC persistence and configurable catch-up grace, so NTP/DST jumps or short downtimes no longer skip alarms.
- Added structured `alarm_probe` JSON telemetry (UTC/local timestamps, monotonic deltas, readiness state, device discovery) covering the ±5 min trigger window for post-mortem analysis.
- Introduced readiness backoff with network/DNS/token/device probes to guarantee Spotify is reachable before playback attempts, plus persisted state to recover missed alarms after reboot.

### 🛠️ Deployment & Operations
- Shipped new systemd assets (`deploy/systemd/*.service|*.timer`) and an `install.sh` helper to install/enable them on the Pi, including an optional readiness timer.
- Extended `scripts/deploy_to_pi.sh` to sync deployment scripts, systemd units, and the new `run_alarm.sh` probe, ensuring rsync allowlists include nested directories.
- Documented diagnostics/runbook artefacts (`docs/diagnostics/*`, `docs/runbooks/alarms.md`, `docs/tests/alarm_reliability.md`) to guide overnight validation and troubleshooting.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added `tests/alarm_reliability/` suite with DST, catch-up, readiness, and persistence coverage.
- `pytest`

## [1.3.5] - 2025-10-15

### 🔄 Alarm Simplification
- Removed the dormant weekday/recurring alarm feature flag – alarms are now always single-use and automatically disable after playback. All APIs, validation paths, and UI payloads were updated to reflect the simplified model.
- Trimmed the frontend assets by dropping the unused weekday bubble widget and related JavaScript wiring.

### 🧪 Tests
- `pytest`

## [1.3.4] - 2025-10-12

### 🎯 Highlights
- Made the runtime timezone configurable via `SPOTIPI_TIMEZONE` or the persisted config; alarm, scheduler and sleep timer now pick up changes immediately through a config-listener.
- Hardened the Spotify token cache with a dedicated refresh lock and thread-safe metrics updates, eliminating duplicate refreshes under load.
- Cached the last known Spotify device ID and reuse it when `/me/player/devices` times out, so alarms still fire even if Spotify is flaky overnight.
- Reworked play/pause handling: the toggle now inspects the active device, passes it to the Spotify API and treats all 2xx responses as success, fixing the stuck-in-pause behaviour.
- Tuned low-power defaults by extending playback/dashboard cache TTLs and relaxing playback request caching to reduce repeated Spotify calls on the Pi.
- `.env` fallback: the Spotify API loader now falls back to the project root `.env` when the home-directory file is absent, fixing token refresh failures on local dev machines.
- Trimmed TLS handshake noise by downgrading the HTTP-port warnings to debug in `TidyRequestHandler`.
- Deployment script now parses rsync’s output format reliably, so the summary shows real counts for updated/created/deleted files.

### 🧪 Tests
- `pytest`

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-07

### ⏰ Alarm & Sleep UX Polishing
- Mirrored sleep-mode behaviour for alarms: the edit form now collapses into an active-state summary with disable toggle and speaker/next-alarm details once the alarm is enabled.
- Added device info and localized status strings to the collapsed alarm view so it is clear which speaker will fire.
- Sleep timer countdown now shows a human-friendly label instead of the raw translation key when active.
- Initial global volume slider pulls the live Spotify device volume (including device-list fallbacks) rather than the static config default.

### 🧪 Tests
- `pytest`

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-06

### ⏰ Alarm Experience Refresh
- Default alarms now behave as one-time events; they automatically disable after playback while keeping the previous configuration intact for fast re-arming.
- Introduced a `features.recurring_alarm_enabled` flag so advanced recurring schedules can be reactivated later without losing stored weekday selections.
- Updated scheduler, service layer, and API payloads to surface both the recurring flag and the currently active weekday set for diagnostics.
- Simplified the alarm editor UI by removing weekday bubbles and adding a localized hint that recurring options will return once the feature flag is enabled.

### 🧰 Configuration & Validation
- Config manager now deep-fills default feature flags across all environments and guards against malformed `features` sections.
- Alarm validation preserves stored weekday data when the UI omits the field, ensuring future releases can re-enable recurring mode seamlessly.

### ⚡ Pi Zero W Performance Pass
- Added a lightweight perf monitor (P50/P95 per Flask route) with rate-limited logging so we can profile the Pi Zero without overwhelming the SD card.
- Replaced ad-hoc Spotify calls with a pooled `requests.Session`, single-flight dedupe for GET requests, and a global semaphore (`SPOTIPI_MAX_CONCURRENCY`) to keep the Pi CPU under control.
- Introduced a two-tier device/library cache: small in-memory LRU plus disk snapshots under `./cache/`, with new env knobs (`SPOTIPI_DEVICE_TTL`, `SPOTIPI_LIBRARY_TTL_MINUTES`).
- Created `scripts/bench.sh` + `/api/perf/metrics` to benchmark cold/warm device discovery and library loads reproducibly.

### 📈 Benchmark Snapshot (run `scripts/bench.sh` on hardware)
| Endpoint | Target P50 | Target P95 | Requests (warm) | Payload |
|----------|------------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| `/api/spotify/devices` | <= 0.20 s | <= 1.50 s | 5 | ~4 KB |
| `/api/music-library?fields=basic` | <= 0.35 s | <= 1.50 s | 5 | ~48 KB |

> Instrumentation is baked in; capture actual before/after numbers on the Pi Zero W with `scripts/bench.sh` and archive them alongside the deployment notes.

### 🧪 Tests
- `pytest`

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-05

### ⚙️ Backend Simplification
- Replaced the heavyweight config read/write locks with a lean mutex + snapshot cache, reducing per-request allocations on the Pi Zero.
- Streamlined rate limiting to a single sliding-window engine that stays disabled in low-power mode but still exposes diagnostics when active.

### 🌐 Device & Playback Responsiveness
- Primed the device list on boot (even in low-power mode) and shortened the cache loop so speakers appear almost instantly after login.
- Introduced a short-lived playback cache (default 3 s) that is invalidated whenever playback state changes, keeping the dashboard snappy while avoiding redundant Spotify calls.
- Aligned all alarm and scheduler time calculations with the `Europe/Vienna` timezone to ensure DST-safe triggers.

### 😴 Sleep Timer & System Metrics
- Added an in-memory sleep-status cache with TTL to avoid hammering the SD card and tightened monitor polling to 15 s in the final two minutes for smoother countdowns.
- Avoid blocking `psutil` CPU sampling on the Pi Zero and reuse the last known reading when low-power mode is active.

### 🔒 Security & Config
- Default CORS now locks to `http://spotipi.local` (overridable via `SPOTIPI_DEFAULT_HOST`) instead of `*`.
- Per-request config snapshots are cached in `flask.g`, eliminating duplicate disk reads for each template render.

### 🧪 Tests
- `python -m compileall src/app.py src/api/spotify.py`

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-04

### 🚀 Dashboard & UI
- Added `/api/dashboard/status`, allowing the web client to refresh alarm, sleep, and playback data in a single request.
- Front-end polling now consumes the aggregated response and maintains the sleep countdown locally for a smoother experience.

### 🍓 Pi Zero Optimisations
- Low-power mode skips the startup warmup prefetch, disables template auto-reload, and automatically turns off the rate limiter to keep the Raspberry Pi Zero responsive.
- Spotify library fetches limit themselves to a single worker, and system metrics are cached to avoid repeated `psutil` calls on constrained hardware.

### 🎛️ Sleep & Playback
- Sleep monitor wakes less frequently outside the fade window and keeps a cached status to drive the countdown without hammering the API.
- Dashboard playback aggregation gracefully handles missing authentication while still updating local device state.

### 🧪 Tests
- `pytest`

---

## [1.2.8] - 2025-10-03

### 😴 Sleep Timer
- Fadedown now tracks the active Spotify device and tapers volume over the final 60 seconds without jumping back up if the user adjusted the level manually.
- Sleep start aborts cleanly when Spotify playback fails instead of leaving a phantom “active” timer.

### ⏰ Alarm Reliability
- Fade-in only remains enabled when the initial volume preset succeeds; otherwise the alarm starts at the configured target volume to avoid loud surprises.

### 🎧 Spotify Integration
- Library and device caches are token-scoped to prevent cross-account bleed-through during multi-user sessions.
- Sleep stop reuses cached access tokens instead of forcing a refresh on every stop.

### 🧪 Tests
- `pytest`

---

## [1.2.7] - 2025-10-02

### 🔄 Deployment & Runtime Cleanup

- Deployment script now ships only runtime-critical files via allowlist `rsync`, keeping Pi deployments lean.
- Added optional `SPOTIPI_PURGE_UNUSED=1` flag to remove legacy assets from existing Raspberry Pi installs.

### 🖥️ Frontend Polish

- Music library loader batches sections more efficiently to minimize HTTP requests on mobile.
- Device manager explicitly initialises focus timers, preventing stray refresh state.

### 📚 Documentation & Tooling

- README and Copilot guide updated with low-power mode, streamlined testing steps, and new deployment workflow.

---

## [1.2.6] - 2025-10-02

### ✅ Highlights

- **Lean Backend:** Removed the unused streaming music library endpoints and helper module, and tightened section loaders so Pi Zero deployments avoid unnecessary thread pools for single-section requests.
- **Snappier UI:** Debounced device refresh on focus, tracked volume-slider interaction timestamps, and batched music-library requests to cut mobile latency without stressing the Pi.
- **CI-Friendly Tests:** Reworked rate-limiting and service-layer suites to use Flask's test client; all 22 tests now execute (no more skipped integration cases).
- **Housekeeping:** Dropped redundant LocalStorage writes and cleaned exports so the Spotify API module only exposes active functions.

### 🧪 Testing

- `pytest` (22 tests, all passing).

---

## [1.2.5] - 2025-10-02

### 🚀 Pi Zero Performance & UX Enhancements

This release focuses on squeezing maximum responsiveness out of the Raspberry Pi Zero deployment while smoothing out a few usability papercuts.

### Added

- **Low Power Mode:** New `SPOTIPI_LOW_POWER=1` toggle disables expensive gzip compression, right-sizes thread pools, and keeps section caching lean for constrained hardware.
- **Section-Aware Library Endpoint:** `/api/music-library` now honours the `sections` query string and skips unnecessary payload work, dramatically cutting CPU usage when the frontend requests slices.

### Changed

- **Frontend Loader:** Progressive loader switches to sequential section fetches aligned with the new backend behaviour, preventing request bursts that overwhelmed the Pi Zero.
- **Global Volume Control:** Slider dispatch now targets the active Spotify device directly and flushes the throttler instantly on release, removing the perceived lag between UI interaction and speaker volume changes.

### Fixed

- **iOS Device Selector:** Focused dropdowns stay enabled during refresh, so the speaker list no longer closes immediately on iPhone.
- **Volume Endpoint:** Backend accepts optional `device_id`, ensuring volume updates reach the intended player even when multiple devices are visible.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-15

### ✨ Enhancement - Immediate UI Response & Performance Optimization

This patch release significantly improves the user experience by eliminating lag in both volume control and play/pause functionality, making the interface much more responsive.

### 🚀 Added

**Immediate Volume Control:**
- Real-time volume control with throttled Spotify API calls (150ms during dragging, 50ms on release)
- Instant visual feedback during volume slider interaction
- Separate volume logic: Global volume (Spotify only) vs Alarm volume (Config + Spotify)

**Optimized Play/Pause Control:**
- Instant button icon updates (fa-play ↔ fa-pause) on click
- New `toggle_playback_fast()` API function without status check
- "Pause-first" strategy for common use case (music playing)
- Fire-and-forget pattern with error rollback

**Enhanced Icons:**
- Speaker/Device selection now uses Spotify icon (`fa-brands fa-spotify`)
- Alarm volume control now shows volume icon (`fas fa-volume-high`)

### 🔧 Improved

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Eliminated double API calls in play/pause toggle (was: status check + toggle → now: direct toggle)
- Reduced perceived lag from ~300ms to immediate UI response
- Background API processing with user feedback

**Volume System Architecture:**
- Global volume slider: Direct Spotify control without config saving
- Alarm volume slider: Independent config storage for alarm-specific volume

- Increased `music_library` limit from 30/min to 100/min
- Increased `status_check` limit from 200/min to 500/min
- Increased `api_strict` limit from 20/min to 50/min

**Reduced Recovery Times:**
- Config changes block time: 10min → 30s
- API general block time: 1min → 30s
- Spotify API block time: 5min → 2min
- Music library block time: 2min → 1min

### 📋 Impact

- ✅ Alarm settings can now be saved without rate limiting errors
- ✅ Smooth UI interactions and responsive interface
- ✅ Better user experience for single-user Raspberry Pi installations

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-05

### ⚙️ Backend Simplification
- Replaced the heavyweight config read/write locks with a lean mutex + snapshot cache, reducing per-request allocations on the Pi Zero.
- Streamlined rate limiting to a single sliding-window engine that stays disabled in low-power mode but still exposes diagnostics when active.

### 🌐 Device & Playback Responsiveness
- Primed the device list on boot (even in low-power mode) and shortened the cache loop so speakers appear almost instantly after login.
- Introduced a short-lived playback cache (default 3 s) that is invalidated whenever playback state changes, keeping the dashboard snappy while avoiding redundant Spotify calls.
- Aligned all alarm and scheduler time calculations with the `Europe/Vienna` timezone to ensure DST-safe triggers.

### 😴 Sleep Timer & System Metrics
- Added an in-memory sleep-status cache with TTL to avoid hammering the SD card and tightened monitor polling to 15 s in the final two minutes for smoother countdowns.
- Avoid blocking `psutil` CPU sampling on the Pi Zero and reuse the last known reading when low-power mode is active.

### 🔒 Security & Config
- Default CORS now locks to `http://spotipi.local` (overridable via `SPOTIPI_DEFAULT_ORIGIN`) instead of `*`.
- Per-request config snapshots are cached in `flask.g`, eliminating duplicate disk reads for each template render.

### 🧪 Tests
- `python -m compileall src/app.py src/api/spotify.py`

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-04

### 🚀 Dashboard & UI
- Added `/api/dashboard/status`, allowing the web client to refresh alarm, sleep, and playback data in a single request.
- Front-end polling now consumes the aggregated response and maintains the sleep countdown locally for a smoother experience.

### 🍓 Pi Zero Optimisations
- Low-power mode skips the startup warmup prefetch, disables template auto-reload, and automatically turns off the rate limiter to keep the Raspberry Pi Zero responsive.
- Spotify library fetches limit themselves to a single worker, and system metrics are cached to avoid repeated `psutil` calls on constrained hardware.

### 🎛️ Sleep & Playback
- Sleep monitor wakes less frequently outside the fade window and keeps a cached status to drive the countdown without hammering the API.
- Dashboard playback aggregation gracefully handles missing authentication while still updating local device state.

### 🧪 Tests
- `pytest`

---

## [1.2.8] - 2025-10-03

### 😴 Sleep Timer
- Fadedown now tracks the active Spotify device and tapers volume over the final 60 seconds without jumping back up if the user adjusted the level manually.
- Sleep start aborts cleanly when Spotify playback fails instead of leaving a phantom “active” timer.

### ⏰ Alarm Reliability
- Fade-in only remains enabled when the initial volume preset succeeds; otherwise the alarm starts at the configured target volume to avoid loud surprises.

### 🎧 Spotify Integration
- Library and device caches are token-scoped to prevent cross-account bleed-through during multi-user sessions.
- Sleep stop reuses cached access tokens instead of forcing a refresh on every stop.

### 🧪 Tests
- `pytest`

---

## [1.2.7] - 2025-10-02

### 🔄 Deployment & Runtime Cleanup

- Deployment script now ships only runtime-critical files via allowlist `rsync`, keeping Pi deployments lean.
- Added optional `SPOTIPI_PURGE_UNUSED=1` flag to remove legacy assets from existing Raspberry Pi installs.

### 🖥️ Frontend Polish

- Music library loader batches sections more efficiently to minimize HTTP requests on mobile.
- Device manager explicitly initialises focus timers, preventing stray refresh state.

### 📚 Documentation & Tooling

- README and Copilot guide updated with low-power mode, streamlined testing steps, and new deployment workflow.

---

## [1.2.6] - 2025-10-02

### ✅ Highlights

- **Lean Backend:** Removed the unused streaming music library endpoints and helper module, and tightened section loaders so Pi Zero deployments avoid unnecessary thread pools for single-section requests.
- **Snappier UI:** Debounced device refresh on focus, tracked volume-slider interaction timestamps, and batched music-library requests to cut mobile latency without stressing the Pi.
- **CI-Friendly Tests:** Reworked rate-limiting and service-layer suites to use Flask's test client; all 22 tests now execute (no more skipped integration cases).
- **Housekeeping:** Dropped redundant LocalStorage writes and cleaned exports so the Spotify API module only exposes active functions.

### 🧪 Testing

- `pytest` (22 tests, all passing).

---

## [1.2.5] - 2025-10-02

### 🚀 Pi Zero Performance & UX Enhancements

This release focuses on squeezing maximum responsiveness out of the Raspberry Pi Zero deployment while smoothing out a few usability papercuts.

### Added

- **Low Power Mode:** New `SPOTIPI_LOW_POWER=1` toggle disables expensive gzip compression, right-sizes thread pools, and keeps section caching lean for constrained hardware.
- **Section-Aware Library Endpoint:** `/api/music-library` now honours the `sections` query string and skips unnecessary payload work, dramatically cutting CPU usage when the frontend requests slices.

### Changed

- **Frontend Loader:** Progressive loader switches to sequential section fetches aligned with the new backend behaviour, preventing request bursts that overwhelmed the Pi Zero.
- **Global Volume Control:** Slider dispatch now targets the active Spotify device directly and flushes the throttler instantly on release, removing the perceived lag between UI interaction and speaker volume changes.

### Fixed

- **iOS Device Selector:** Focused dropdowns stay enabled during refresh, so the speaker list no longer closes immediately on iPhone.
- **Volume Endpoint:** Backend accepts optional `device_id`, ensuring volume updates reach the intended player even when multiple devices are visible.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-15

### ✨ Enhancement - Immediate UI Response & Performance Optimization

This patch release significantly improves the user experience by eliminating lag in both volume control and play/pause functionality, making the interface much more responsive.

### 🚀 Added

**Immediate Volume Control:**
- Real-time volume control with throttled Spotify API calls (150ms during dragging, 50ms on release)
- Instant visual feedback during volume slider interaction
- Separate volume logic: Global volume (Spotify only) vs Alarm volume (Config + Spotify)

**Optimized Play/Pause Control:**
- Instant button icon updates (fa-play ↔ fa-pause) on click
- New `toggle_playback_fast()` API function without status check
- "Pause-first" strategy for common use case (music playing)
- Fire-and-forget pattern with error rollback

**Enhanced Icons:**
- Speaker/Device selection now uses Spotify icon (`fa-brands fa-spotify`)
- Alarm volume control now shows volume icon (`fas fa-volume-high`)

### 🔧 Improved

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Eliminated double API calls in play/pause toggle (was: status check + toggle → now: direct toggle)
- Reduced perceived lag from ~300ms to immediate UI response
- Background API processing with user feedback

**Volume System Architecture:**
- Global volume slider: Direct Spotify control without config saving
- Alarm volume slider: Independent config storage for alarm-specific volume
- Removed redundant `volume` field from config (only `alarm_volume` needed)

- Prevented volume slider interference between different controls
- Optimized volume API calls with smart throttling

### 🐛 Fixed

**Config Cleanup:**
- Removed unused `volume` field from all config files
- Updated alarm execution to use only `alarm_volume`
- Cleaned up volume endpoint to focus on Spotify-only control

### 📋 Migration Notes

Existing configs will automatically migrate:
- `volume` field is no longer used/saved
- `alarm_volume` remains unchanged and continues to work
- No user action required for existing installations

## [1.2.1] - 2025-09-15

### 🐛 Critical Bugfix - Rate Limiting

This patch release fixes a critical production issue where alarm settings couldn't be saved due to overly restrictive rate limiting for single-user installations.

### 🔧 Fixed

**Rate Limiting Optimization for Single-User Installation:**
- Increased `config_changes` limit from 10/min to 100/min
- Increased `api_general` limit from 100/min to 300/min  
- Increased `spotify_api` limit from 50/min to 80/min (respects Spotify's 100/min limit)
- Increased `music_library` limit from 30/min to 100/min
- Increased `status_check` limit from 200/min to 500/min
- Increased `api_strict` limit from 20/min to 50/min

**Reduced Recovery Times:**
- Config changes block time: 10min → 30s
- API general block time: 1min → 30s
- Spotify API block time: 5min → 2min
- Music library block time: 2min → 1min

### 📋 Impact

- ✅ Alarm settings can now be saved without rate limiting errors
